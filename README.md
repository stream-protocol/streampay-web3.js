# StreamPay JavaScript SDK

To create a StreamPayments application using JavaScript for the Solana blockchain.

1. **Setup Your Environment:**
   Before you start, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If not, you can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

2. **Create a New Project:**
   Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in your terminal.

3. **Initialize Your Project:**
   Run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project and create a `package.json` file:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Solana JavaScript SDK:**
   Install the Solana JavaScript SDK using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install @solana/web3.js
   ```

5. **Write Your StreamPayments Code:**
   Create a JavaScript file, e.g., `streamPayments.js`, and add the following code to create a basic StreamPayments application:

   ```javascript
   const { Connection, Keypair, Transaction, SystemProgram, sendAndConfirmTransaction } = require('@solana/web3.js');

   async function createStreamPayments() {
       // Connect to the Solana network
       const connection = new Connection('https://api.devnet.solana.com', 'recent');

       // Replace with your own wallet's private key
       const payerPrivateKey = Uint8Array.from([/* Private key bytes go here */]);
       const payerKeypair = Keypair.fromSecretKey(payerPrivateKey);

       // Create a new recipient account
       const recipientKeypair = Keypair.generate();

       // Construct a transaction to create the recipient account
       const transaction = new Transaction().add(
           SystemProgram.createAccount({
               fromPubkey: payerKeypair.publicKey,
               newAccountPubkey: recipientKeypair.publicKey,
               lamports: 1000000, // Initial funding amount
               space: 1024,
               programId: SystemProgram.programId,
           })
       );

       // Sign and send the transaction
       await sendAndConfirmTransaction(connection, transaction, [payerKeypair, recipientKeypair]);

       console.log(`Recipient account created: ${recipientKeypair.publicKey.toBase58()}`);
   }

   createStreamPayments().catch(console.error);
   ```

   Replace `'https://api.devnet.solana.com'` with the appropriate Solana network URL.

6. **Run Your Application:**
   Run your StreamPayments application using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node streamPayments.js
   ```

Please note that this is a basic example to demonstrate the concept of creating a StreamPayments application on Solana. In a real-world scenario, you would need to handle additional complexities such as payment schedules, handling payment streams, and managea security aspects carefully. Additionally, handling private keys in code as shown in this example is not secure; you should use appropriate key management practices in a production environment.
